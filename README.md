# PasTree IDE Plugin

## Repo layout

This repo was split out of `object-pascal-tree`'s `ide-plugin/` directory
(2026-08-16, no history carried over - see that repo's git log for the
prior commits). The package still compiles the ~20 `PasTree.*.pas` analysis
units directly, now via a **sibling-checkout** relative path:
`..\object-pascal-tree\source\PasTree.*.pas` (see `PasTreeIdePlugin.dpk`
and `PasTreeIdePlugin.dproj`). This means `object-pascal-tree` must be
checked out as a sibling directory of this repo (e.g. both under
`C:\Repos\`) for the package to build.

A sibling `pastree-lsp-server` repo will eventually host an out-of-process
LSP server wrapping the same analysis, with this plugin becoming a thin
LSP client - see the architecture note further down. That move hasn't
happened yet; this plugin still runs `TPasSemaProject` in-process.

A RAD Studio IDE package that surfaces PasTree's analysis inside the Delphi
editor itself. Two features so far: **Find References** (the feature
already available in `object-pascal-tree`'s `demo/`) and **Go to
Declaration**, replacing RAD
Studio's own DelphiLSP-based navigation (reported to work poorly on large
projects) - both the native menu item and Ctrl+Click.

## Status: PoC — confirmed working in-process, on small/test projects

Built directly from RAD Studio's own official samples
(`Samples\Object Pascal\ToolsAPI\Editor Demos\...`), not from an
unofficial/community API surface.

### Menu

Both "Find Declaration (PasTree)" and "Find References (PasTree)" live
together at the top of the editor's right-click menu, in the Identifier
category (`cEdMenuCatIdentifier` in `ToolsAPI.pas`) - the exact slot RAD
Studio's native "Find Declaration" used to occupy alone. See "Go to
Declaration" below for how the native item got replaced.

### Find References

- Results go to a dedicated "Find References" tab in the Messages panel
  (`IOTAMessageServices.AddMessageGroup`), grouped by file (one header row
  per file via `AddToolMessage`'s own `Parent`/`LineRef` mechanism - same
  tree structure "Find in Files" uses), each hit carrying file/line/column
  so the IDE's own message navigation (double-click, Enter, F8/Shift+F8)
  jumps straight to it.

### Go to Declaration

Two ways to trigger the same resolve+navigate logic
(`PasTreeIdePlugin.GotoDeclaration.ResolveAndNavigate`), both **confirmed
working**:

- **Native menu item replaced.** The built-in "Find Declaration" is removed
  via `INTAEditorLocalMenu.UnregisterActionList(cEdMenuCatIdentifier)` and
  replaced with our own action registered under that same category string
  (`PasTreeIdePlugin.Wizard.TMenuManager` - lands in the exact same, first,
  menu position). **Caveat:** this is a one-way door within a running IDE
  session - there's no handle to the native action list to restore it, so
  uninstalling the package without restarting the IDE would leave "Find
  Declaration" missing until restart (which the project's own workflow
  already does after every rebuild - see project memory on package
  hot-reload).
- **Ctrl+Click override.** Hooks `INTACodeEditorServices.AddEditorEventsNotifier`
  (`ToolsAPI.Editor.pas`, the same mechanism the official "KeyboardMouse
  Events Demo" sample uses) and intercepts
  `OnEditorMouseDownEx`/`OnEditorMouseUpEx`: on Ctrl+Left-click it resolves
  the identifier under the cursor and navigates there itself, setting
  `Handled := True` to suppress RAD Studio's own default handling
  (documented as "prevent further processing" - `ToolsAPI.Editor.pas:804-806`).

Every successful jump registers with `IOTAHistoryServices` (the same global
Backward/Forward stack the IDE's own Alt+Left/Alt+Right toolbar buttons
use), via `PushHistoryAndNavigate`/`TPasHistoryItem` - so Alt+Left/Right work
across our jumps too. Every history item handed to the IDE is tracked and
removed via `RemoveHistoryItem` at package unload (`ClearHistoryItems`) -
left registered, a stale entry would call `.Execute` on an object living in
already-unloaded package code the next time the user pressed Alt-Left/Right.

### Shared analysis pipeline

Both Go to Declaration entry points, and Find References, call
`PasTreeIdePlugin.Analysis.BuildNavigator`, which:
- Resolves the active project's real `.dpr`/`.dpk` (`IOTAProject.FileName`
  is the `.dproj` MSBuild wrapper, unparseable by PasTree).
- Overlays live buffer text for every currently-**open** unit
  (`IOTAModuleServices.Modules` - never forcing anything open; an earlier
  version walked every project unit via `IOTAProject.GetModule`+`OpenModule`,
  which force-instantiated every unopened form's design surface).
- Builds a `TPasSemaProject` (`SingleThreaded := True` - see below) and
  `TPasNavigator`, whose three-identity lookup (symbol / unit / builtin -
  see `source/PasTree.Sema.Nav.pas`) resolves whatever's at a given
  file/line/column.
- **Cached across calls.** Rebuilding this from scratch on every menu click
  - and now every Ctrl+Click - was too slow once RTL/VCL search paths were
  added (a full reparse per click, visibly). The built pair is kept alive
  in a package-lifetime cache and only rebuilt when the active project
  changed or an open unit's live text differs from last time (content
  comparison, not time-based). `BuildNavigator`'s result is cache-owned -
  callers must not free it. Known gap: changes to files not open in an
  editor tab aren't detected (no filesystem watcher) - acceptable since
  RTL/VCL essentially never changes mid-session.

### Diagnostics

Logged only on failure (no active project, cursor's file not analyzed, no
identifier resolved, unhandled exception) - not on every step or on
success. Go to Declaration fires on every Ctrl+Click, far more often than a
menu click, so logging progress/success would be much noisier than useful.
Goes to the IDE's own default Messages tab (the "Build" tab -
`AddTitleMessage` with no group), tagged `[pastree]` so it's identifiable
alongside compiler/linker output, rather than into a dedicated tab of its
own.

## Architecture: in-process for now, by design

This runs the full `TPasSemaProject` analysis **inside the 32-bit designtime
package**, synchronously. That's a deliberate, accepted limitation for this
PoC stage - not an oversight:

- A designtime package is forced to run **Win32** (the IDE itself is a
  32-bit process) - there is no way to make this package itself Win64.
- The real target project this plugin is ultimately for is large enough to
  need **Win64 and several GB** to analyze (see project memory - the same
  codebase OOMs when analyzed as Win32). Running that analysis inside this
  Win32 package is expected to fail or be unusable at that scale.
- The analysis result is cached (see "Shared analysis pipeline" above), so
  this is only a full reparse on a cache miss (project switch, or an open
  unit's text changed) - not on every single call anymore.

The intended fix, once this moves past PoC: an **out-of-process Win64
helper** (extending `tools\PasTreeSemaProject.dpr`) that this plugin talks
to instead of calling `TPasSemaProject` directly in-process. Deliberately
not built yet - see the architecture note at the top of
`PasTreeIdePlugin.FindReferences.pas`.

## Known first-pass limitations

- `uses` resolution includes the active project's own directory, every open
  unit's directory, and (as of 2026-08-15) RTL/VCL/ToolsAPI source
  (`GetIDESourcePaths` in `PasTreeIdePlugin.Analysis.pas`, rooted at
  `IOTAServices.GetRootDirectory`, no hardcoded version) - `TActionList`,
  `IOTAWizard`, etc. now resolve correctly. This was disabled once after an
  AV, re-enabled and re-tested clean after a full IDE restart - the AV was
  most likely the package-hot-reload issue below, not a real bug, but a
  theoretical concurrency risk in PasTree's own `TPasSourceManager` is
  still unconfirmed either way (project memory:
  `pastree-rtl-vcl-scale-av-suspect`). Disable again (see
  `CollectSearchPaths`'s comment) if it ever AVs after a *clean* restart.
- Project `$DEFINE`s aren't read from the `.dproj` yet - `TPasSemaProject`
  is created with an empty extra-defines list.
- Platform is read from `IOTAProject.CurrentPlatform` and mapped to the
  closest `TPasPlatform` (`MapPlatform`) - PasTree doesn't model every RAD
  Studio target (no ARM64EC, no 32-bit non-Windows), those fall back to the
  nearest 64-bit equivalent or `pfWin32`.
- Rebuilding this package inside the same running IDE session is unreliable
  even with an explicit Uninstall/Build/Install cycle - always restart the
  IDE before testing a rebuild (see project memory on package hot-reload;
  the likely cause is `AddEditorEventsNotifier` not being fully torn down
  by the IDE's own Uninstall step).

## Files

- `PasTreeIdePlugin.dpk` / `.dproj` - package project, `Win32`.
  `requires: rtl, vcl, designide`; `contains` the plugin's own four units
  plus the same ~20 `PasTree.*.pas` units `object-pascal-tree`'s
  `demo/PasTreeDemo.dproj` already depends on, referenced from the sibling
  `object-pascal-tree` checkout (not trimmed to a minimal subset, since
  that combination is already proven to compile together - see "Repo
  layout" above).
- `PasTreeIdePlugin.Wizard.pas` - `TIDEWizard` (`IOTAWizard`): owns the
  single editor-menu action list (Find Declaration + Find References,
  both under Identifier) and the Ctrl+Click notifier's lifetime.
- `PasTreeIdePlugin.Analysis.pas` - shared plumbing: active-project lookup,
  live-buffer gathering, search-path/platform resolution, and
  `BuildNavigator` (the `TPasSemaProject`+`TPasNavigator` pipeline every
  feature calls).
- `PasTreeIdePlugin.FindReferences.pas` - Find References logic and
  Messages-panel reporting. Its unit header has the fuller architecture
  note and a TODO list for what's next (out-of-process, real defines,
  snippet highlighting).
- `PasTreeIdePlugin.GotoDeclaration.pas` - the Ctrl+Click override plus the
  shared `ResolveAndNavigate`/`ExecuteGotoDeclaration` used by both Go to
  Declaration entry points: mouse event interception, cursor
  pixel→file-position conversion, navigation, and `IOTAHistoryServices`
  integration (`TPasHistoryItem`) for Backward/Forward.
